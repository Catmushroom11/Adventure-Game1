# Adventure-Game
This game is an adventure that changes depending on what choices you make. 
The game play will differ each time you play if you choose different options each time.
It is like a choose your own adventure book.
You will need to import the code into an area where you can run, but I will add a link to where you can run it when I'm finished.
Have Fun!
Here is the link https://replit.com/@Catmushroom11/Adventure-Game?v=1 it is pretty bad because I found out from someone playing that you can look at the code and see the answers so I will be editing it later at some point. If you know how to make it randomized you can let me know.
